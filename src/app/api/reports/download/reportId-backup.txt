This is a backup of the [reportId] route.ts file that was created earlier.
The [id] route has been updated with the same functionality.
You can delete the [reportId] folder manually.

Original file path: src/app/api/reports/download/[reportId]/route.ts

This file contained the enhanced download functionality with reportData support,
which has now been integrated into the [id] route.
