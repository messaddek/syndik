# B2B Helpdesk Implementation Guide

## Overview

The helpdesk system has been enhanced to support both **internal tickets** (residents to property managers) and **B2B tickets** (syndicates to app owner). This dual-mode system uses a flag-based approach to distinguish between different ticket types while maintaining a unified codebase.

## Implementation Status

âœ… **Completed:**

- Database schema changes (new columns and indexes)
- Backend procedures for B2B ticket creation and filtering
- Frontend components for B2B ticket creation
- Permission-based access control for B2B features
- Documentation

âœ… **Latest Changes:**

- Added permission-based visibility for B2B features
- Implemented ticket type tabs for switching between internal and B2B tickets
- Created custom hook for helpdesk permissions
- Added distinct visual styling for B2B elements

## Architecture

### Flag-Based System Design

We use a simple but effective flag-based approach:

- `isB2B`: Boolean flag to distinguish B2B tickets from internal tickets
- `ticketType`: Text field with values 'internal' or 'b2b'
- Additional B2B-specific fields for enhanced functionality

### Database Schema Changes

#### New Fields Added to `helpdesk_tickets` Table

```sql
-- B2B identification
is_b2b BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT false
ticket_type TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'internal'

-- B2B-specific fields
syndicate_info JSONB -- Organization contact information
urgency_level TEXT -- 'low', 'medium', 'high', 'critical'
business_impact TEXT -- Description of business impact
affected_users INTEGER -- Number of users affected

-- Indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX helpdesk_tickets_is_b2b_idx ON helpdesk_tickets (is_b2b);
CREATE INDEX helpdesk_tickets_ticket_type_idx ON helpdesk_tickets (ticket_type);
```

#### Syndicate Info JSON Structure

```json
{
  "organizationName": "Syndicate ABC",
  "contactName": "John Manager",
  "contactEmail": "john@syndicateabc.com",
  "contactPhone": "+1234567890",
  "organizationSize": "medium", // small, medium, large, enterprise
  "subscriptionTier": "Pro"
}
```

## Implementation Benefits

### âœ… Advantages of This Approach

1. **Unified System**: Single codebase handles both internal and B2B tickets
2. **Easy Filtering**: Simple flag-based filtering for different views
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing internal system continues to work unchanged
4. **Minimal Database Changes**: Only added new columns, no structural changes
5. **Flexible**: Easy to add more ticket types in the future
6. **Performance**: Indexed flags allow efficient querying
7. **Cost Effective**: No need for separate systems or infrastructure

### ðŸŽ¯ Key Features

#### For Internal Tickets (Existing)

- Resident to Property Manager/Admin tickets
- Building and unit associations
- Standard categories (maintenance, complaints, etc.)
- Organization-scoped visibility

#### For B2B Tickets (New)

- Syndicate to App Owner tickets
- Enhanced priority levels with urgency
- Business impact assessment
- Affected user tracking
- Syndicate contact information
- App owner-only visibility

## API Endpoints

### B2B Ticket Creation

```typescript
// Public endpoint for syndicates to create B2B tickets
createB2BTicket: protectedProcedure
  .input(createB2BTicketSchema)
  .mutation(async ({ ctx, input }) => {
    // Creates ticket with isB2B: true, ticketType: 'b2b'
    // Stores in special 'app-owner-org' organization
  });
```

### B2B Ticket Management (App Owner Only)

```typescript
// Get B2B tickets - restricted to app owner organization
getB2BTickets: orgProtectedProcedure.query(async ({ ctx, input }) => {
  // Only accessible if ctx.orgId === 'app-owner-org'
});

// Get B2B statistics and analytics
getB2BStats: orgProtectedProcedure.query(async ({ ctx }) => {
  // Dashboard metrics for app owner
});
```

### Enhanced Filtering

```typescript
// Unified endpoint supporting both internal and B2B tickets
getAllTickets: orgProtectedProcedure
  .input(ticketFilterSchema) // includes ticketType filter
  .query(async ({ ctx, input }) => {
    // Filters by: 'internal', 'b2b', or 'all'
    // App owner sees all, regular orgs see only internal
  });
```

## User Experience

### For Syndicates (B2B Customers)

1. **Enhanced Ticket Form**: Collects business impact, affected users, urgency level
2. **Organization Information**: Captures syndicate details for better support
3. **Business-Focused Categories**: Technical issues, feature requests, billing inquiries
4. **Priority + Urgency**: Dual-level prioritization for better escalation

### For App Owner (Support Team)

1. **Separate B2B Dashboard**: Dedicated view for B2B tickets
2. **Enhanced Analytics**: Business impact metrics, affected user counts
3. **Syndicate Context**: Full organization information for personalized support
4. **SLA Management**: Urgency levels for proper response time management

### For Regular Organizations (Internal Users)

1. **No Changes**: Existing functionality remains identical
2. **Transparent**: B2B features are invisible to internal users
3. **Performance**: No impact on existing queries or operations

## Security & Access Control

### Access Levels

1. **App Owner Organization** (`app-owner-org`):

   - Can view/manage ALL tickets (internal + B2B)
   - Access to B2B statistics and analytics
   - Special organization ID for app owner team

2. **Regular Organizations**:

   - Can only view/manage their internal tickets
   - No access to B2B tickets or other orgs' tickets
   - Existing security model unchanged

3. **Public B2B Creation**:
   - Syndicates can create B2B tickets via public endpoint
   - Authentication required but no organization restriction
   - Tickets automatically assigned to app owner organization

### Data Isolation

- B2B tickets stored with `orgId: 'app-owner-org'`
- Internal tickets remain organization-scoped
- Database-level isolation through organization filtering
- No cross-contamination of data

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Database Schema Update

```sql
-- Add new columns with sensible defaults
ALTER TABLE helpdesk_tickets ADD COLUMN is_b2b BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT false;
ALTER TABLE helpdesk_tickets ADD COLUMN ticket_type TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'internal';
-- ... additional columns
```

### Phase 2: Backend Implementation

- Enhanced schemas for B2B ticket creation
- New tRPC procedures for B2B functionality
- Enhanced filtering and querying logic

### Phase 3: Frontend Components

Completed:

- B2B ticket creation dialog with custom form fields
- Conditional rendering based on user permissions
- Ticket type tabs for switching between internal and B2B tickets
- Distinct styling for B2B elements (orange color scheme)

In Progress:

- App owner dashboard for B2B tickets
- Enhanced filtering UI for B2B-specific fields

### Phase 4: Testing & Deployment

Completed:

- Access control implementation
- Integration with existing ticket system

In Progress:

- Test B2B creation flow
- End-to-end testing with mixed ticket types
- Performance testing with large ticket volumes

## Monitoring & Analytics

### B2B Metrics

- Ticket volume by syndicate
- Average response times
- Business impact distribution
- Affected user totals
- Category breakdown
- Resolution time tracking

### Internal Metrics (Unchanged)

- Existing internal helpdesk metrics continue working
- No impact on existing reporting

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Extensions

1. **Multiple Ticket Types**: Easy to add 'partner', 'vendor', 'support' types
2. **SLA Management**: Automated escalation based on urgency levels
3. **Integration APIs**: External ticket system synchronization
4. **Custom Fields**: Per-organization ticket field customization
5. **Workflow Automation**: Status transition rules and notifications

### Scalability Considerations

- Indexed flags ensure query performance
- Partitioning possible by ticket_type if needed
- Horizontal scaling maintains organization isolation
- Caching strategies can leverage ticket_type for efficient invalidation

## Conclusion

This flag-based approach provides the perfect balance of:

- **Simplicity**: Easy to understand and maintain
- **Flexibility**: Room for future enhancements
- **Performance**: Efficient querying and filtering
- **Security**: Proper access control and data isolation
- **Cost**: Minimal infrastructure changes

The dual-mode helpdesk system successfully serves both internal syndicate operations and B2B customer support needs while maintaining clean separation of concerns and excellent user experiences for all stakeholders.
