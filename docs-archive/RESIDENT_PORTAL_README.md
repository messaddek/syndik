# 🏠 Resident Portal Implementation

## 🎉 **Portal Successfully Created!**

The Syndik Resident Portal has been implemented with the following features:

### ✅ **Core Features Implemented**

1. **🔐 Role-Based Authentication**

   - Uses Clerk with `member` role for residents
   - Automatic redirection based on user roles
   - Separate portal area (`/portal`) for residents

2. **👤 User Setup & Profile**

   - Resident account setup form (`/portal/setup`)
   - Links resident accounts to existing resident records
   - Profile management capabilities

3. **🏡 Portal Dashboard**

   - Welcome dashboard with resident information
   - Unit details and building information
   - Quick access to payment, announcements, and meetings
   - Personal profile overview

4. **🎨 Modern UI Components**
   - Dedicated portal sidebar navigation
   - Portal-specific navbar with search and notifications
   - Responsive design matching the admin interface

### 🛠️ **Technical Implementation**

1. **Database Schema Updates**

   - Extended `accounts` table to support `member` role
   - Utilizes existing `users` table for resident profiles
   - Links to existing `residents` table for validation

2. **tRPC API**

   - New `portal` router with resident-specific procedures
   - Setup, profile management, and data retrieval endpoints
   - Proper authentication and organization scoping

3. **Route Protection**
   - Role-based guards to redirect users appropriately
   - Managers/admins → `/dashboard`
   - Members/residents → `/portal`

### 🔄 **User Flow**

1. **New Resident Registration:**

   - Signs up via Clerk
   - Gets added to organization (residence)
   - Completes setup at `/portal/setup`
   - Must match existing resident record (email + unit)

2. **Daily Usage:**
   - Logs in and sees personalized dashboard
   - Access to payments, announcements, meetings
   - Profile management and settings

### 🚀 **Next Steps to Complete**

To fully activate the resident portal, you would need to:

1. **Create resident records** in the admin panel for each unit
2. **Add financial features** (payment processing, statements)
3. **Build communication features** (announcements, messaging)
4. **Add meeting participation** features

### 🧪 **Testing the Portal**

1. Create a test resident record in the admin interface
2. Sign up a new user in Clerk and add them to the organization
3. Visit `/portal/setup` to complete the resident setup
4. Experience the full resident dashboard
